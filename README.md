## Command Line Reporter

This gem provides an simple way to add RSpec like formatting of the output of your ruby scripts.  It
eliminates the need to litter your code with *puts* statements instead providing a cleaner, more
ruby like way of reporting progress to the user through the command line interface.

With the release of Version 2.0, it is now possible to format your output using tables with and
without borders.  See the section on *Tables* in the wiki for more details.

### Installation

It is up on rubygems.org so add it to your bundle or do it the old fashioned way:

```bash
gem install command_line_reporter
```

### Usage

The gem provides a mixin that can be included in your scripts.

```ruby
require 'command_line_reporter'

class MyReport
  include CommandLineReporter
  ...
end
```

### Standard Methods

There are several methods the mixin provides that do not depend on the formatter used:

* _header(hash)_ and _footer(hash)_
  * _:title_ - The title text for the section.  _Default: 'Report'_
  * _:width_ - The width in characters for the section.  _Default: 100_
  * _:align_ - 'left'|'right'|'center' align the title text.  _Default: 'left'_
  * _:spacing_ - Number of vertical lines to leave as spacing after|before the header|footer.
    _Default: 1_
  * _:timestamp_ - Include a line indicating the timestamp below|above the header|footer text.
    Either true|false.  _Default: false_
  * _:rule_ - true|false indicates whether to include a horizontal rule below|above the
    header|footer.  _Default: false_
* _report(hash) {block}_
  * The first argument is a hash that defines the options for the method. See the details in the
    formatter section for allowed values.
  * The second argument is a block of ruby code that you want executed within the context of the
    reporter.  Any ruby code is allowed.  See the examples that follow in the formatter sections for
    details.
* _formatter=(string)_
  * Factory method indicating the formatter you want your application to use.  At present the 2
    formatters are (_Default: 'nested'_):
  * 'progress' - Use the progress formatter
  * 'nested' - Use the nested (or documentation) formatter
* _horizontal_rule(hash)_
  * _:char_ - The character used to build the rule.  _Default: '-'_
  * _:width_ - The width in characters of the rule.  _Default: 100_
* _vertical_spacing(int)_
  * Number of blank lines to output.  _Default: 1_
* _datetime(hash)_
  * _:align_ - 'left'|'center'|'right' alignment of the timestamp.  _Default: 'left'_
  * _:width_ - The width of the string in characters.  _Default: 100_
  * _:format_ - Any allowed format from #strftime#.  _Default: %Y-%m-%d %H:%I:%S%p_
* _aligned(string, hash)_
  * _text_ - String to display
  * _:align_ - 'left'|'right'|'center' align the string text.  _Default: 'left'_
  * _:width_ - The width in characters of the string text.  _Default: 100_
* _table(hash) {block}_
  * The first argument is a hash that defines properties of the table.
    * _:border_ - true|false indicates whether to include borders around the table cells
  * The second argument is a block which includes calls the to the _row_ method
* _row {block}_
  * Only argument is a block with calls to _column_ allowed
* _column(string, hash)_
  * _text_ - String to display in the table cell
  * _options_ - The options to define the column
    * :width - defines the width of the column
    * :padding - The number of spaces to put on both the left and right of the text.
    * :align - Allowed values are left|right|center

### To Do

* Add the ability for a column to span across others
* Add the progress method to the top level mixin so that there is no need to invoke through the
  formatter.
